# PNS
Standardizes Part Numbers for Engineered components

This is a clone of an internal ASPX .NET program used by my company. This version will be lighter and FAR easier to maintain.

The plan is to create a simple indexed database using SQLite
Connect that via Python's FLASK framework
..To a front-end built using bootstrap (TBD?)
